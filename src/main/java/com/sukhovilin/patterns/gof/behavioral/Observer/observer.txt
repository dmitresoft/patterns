definition
	Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes 
	state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. 

participants

    The classes and/or objects participating in this pattern are:

    * Subject  (Stock)
          o knows its observers. Any number of Observer objects may observe a subject
          o provides an interface for attaching and detaching Observer objects.
    * ConcreteSubject  (IBM)
          o stores state of interest to ConcreteObserver
          o sends a notification to its observers when its state changes
    * Observer  (IInvestor)
          o defines an updating interface for objects that should be notified of changes in a subject.
    * ConcreteObserver  (Investor)
          o maintains a reference to a ConcreteSubject object
          o stores state that should stay consistent with the subject's
          o implements the Observer updating interface to keep its state consistent with the subject's
